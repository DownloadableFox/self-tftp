If it's true what they say?
Is this how the world is

To be beaten and betrayed and be told that nothing changes
It will always be like this
If it's true what they say- I'll be on my way
But who are they to say what the truth is anyway?

'Cause the ones who tell tell the lies
Are the solemnest to swear
And the ones who load the dice
Always say the toss is fair

And the ones who deal the cards (Deal the cards)
Are the ones who take the tricks
With their hands over their hearts
While we play the game they fix

And the ones who speak the words (Speak the words)
Always say it is the last
And the answer will be heard
To the question no one asks

So I'm asking if it's true,
I'm asking me, and you and you and you

I believe our answer matters more than anything they say
(We stand and listen x3)

I believe if there is still a will-
then there is still a way
(We're standing with him)

I believe there's still a way
I believe in us together
More than anyone alone
(We're standing near him)

I believe that with each other-
we are stronger than we know
(We hear him)

I believe we're stronger than they know
I believe we're many, I believe that they're few
(We're standing x3)

And it isn't for the few to tell the many what is true
I'll ask you- is it true what they say?
I'll be on my way
Tell me what to do
Is it true? Is it true what they say?
